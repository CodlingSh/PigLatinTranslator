# PigLatinTranslator
A simple Pig Latin translator written in C#.

Not only can this translate words to Pig Latin, but it also pay attention and formats words using proper grammar and capitalization rules (E.G. The string "Horay!" will get translated as "Orayhay!" instead of oray!""H like some of the other translators I've seen online do).
